# Zubridge Mission (Lite)

Zubridge is a cross-platform state management library for multi-process desktop and mobile applications.

Zubridge serves developers building desktop and mobile applications who need Zustand's familiar API with automatic state synchronization across process boundaries. Built on a unified Rust core, Zubridge provides a consistent API across Electron, Tauri, and upcoming support for Flutter, Neutralino, and Blazor - designed to scale from simple apps to performance-critical use cases.
