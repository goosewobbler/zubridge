# Spec Summary (Lite)

Establish the foundational `zubridge-core` Rust crate with conditional compilation for UniFFI, NAPI-RS, and Tauri targets, enabling a unified core for all framework integrations. Implement minimal working example (`create_store()` function) that compiles and exports correctly for all three platforms, define middleware architecture, and set up testing/CI infrastructure to validate the architecture before full implementation.
