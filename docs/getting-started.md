## Getting Started

Install zubridge-electron and peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i zubridge-electron zustand
```

Or use your dependency manager of choice, e.g. `pnpm`, `yarn`.

The following instructions assume you are using TypeScript. First, create your Zustand store using `zustand/vanilla` in the main process:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla';

store = createStore<AppState>()(() => initialState);
```

Then initialise the bridge in the main process. The bridge needs your store, ipcMain and an array of BrowserWindow objects for your app, so for a single window application:

```ts
import { ipcMain, type BrowserWindow } from 'electron';
import { mainZustandBridge } from 'zubridge-electron/main';

// create mainWindow

const { unsubscribe } = mainZustandBridge(ipcMain, store, [mainWindow]);

app.on('quit', unsubscribe);
```

Next, initialise the bridge in the preload script. Here the bridge needs the State type and the ipcRenderer. The bridge initialiser will return a set of handlers which should be exposed to the renderer process via the `contextBridge` module.

```ts
import { ipcRenderer, contextBridge } from 'electron';
import { preloadZustandBridge } from 'zubridge-electron/preload';

import type { AppState } from '../features/index.js';

export const { handlers } = preloadZustandBridge<AppState>(ipcRenderer);

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('zubridge-electron', handlers);
```

Finally, in the renderer process you will need to create the useStore hook:

`/renderer/hooks/useStore.ts`

```ts
import { createUseStore } from 'zubridge-electron';
import { AppState } from '../../features/index.js';

export const useStore = createUseStore<AppState>(window.zubridge - electron);
```

### Accessing the Store in the Renderer Process

In the renderer process you should now be able to access the store via the `useStore` hook:

```ts
const counter = useStore((x) => x.counter);
```

You can use the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions and thunks to the store:

```ts
const dispatch = useDispatch(window.zubridge - electron);
const onIncrement = () => dispatch('COUNTER:INCREMENT');
```

If you are using a thunk, the dispatch function and the store are passed in:

```ts
const onIncrementThunk = (getState, dispatch) => {
  // do something based on the store
  dispatch('COUNTER:INCREMENT');
};
const dispatch = useDispatch(window.zubridge - electron);
const onIncrement = () => dispatch(onIncrementThunk);
```

### Accessing the Store in the Main Process

In the main process you can access the store object directly, any updates will be propagated to the renderer process.

The main process dispatch helper can be used to dispatch actions and thunks, in a similar way to the `useDispatch` hook in the renderer process:

```ts
import { createDispatch } from 'zubridge-electron/main';

dispatch = createDispatch(store);

dispatch('COUNTER:INCREMENT');
```

By default the main process dispatch helper assumes your store handler functions are located on the store object.

If you keep your store handler functions separate from the store then you will need to pass them in as an option:

```ts
import { handlers as counterHandlers } from '../../features/counter/index.js';
import { handlers as uiHandlers } from '../../features/ui/index.js';

const actionHandlers = (store: AppStore, initialState: AppState) => ({
  ...counterHandlers(store),
  ...uiHandlers(store),
  'STORE:RESET': () => store.setState(initialState, true),
});

dispatch = createDispatch(store, { handlers: actionHandlers(store, initialState) });
```

Alternatively if you are using Redux-style reducers you will need to pass the root reducer in as an option:

```ts
import { reducer as counterReducer } from '../../features/counter/index.js';
import { reducer as uiReducer } from '../../features/ui/index.js';

const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case types.counter:
      return counterReducer(state.counter, action);
    case types.ui:
      return uiReducer(state.ui, action);
  }
};

dispatch = createDispatch(store, { reducer: rootReducer });
```
